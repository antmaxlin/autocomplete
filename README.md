autocomplete
============

Basic and flexible AJAX autocomplete. No jQuery use, pure simple AJAX. Allows images, categories, and any other way you want to format results. Ultimate flexibility, since you control what data to display and style the response.

*Note - jQuery can satisfy most needs and thus simplify your code. Check my other project - autocomplete_jquery_ui for a guide how to build complex autocomplete.

Autocomplete with images useful to direct to a specific item, so mouseclick or keydown-enter should immediate redirect to that item page.

Setup
=====

Add your database info to /includes/initiate.php
Edit autocomplete.php to retrieve the information you wish to display. For this example I used the following:

input: term, category id
output: object name, image, url

Edit style.css to position response box
